  /// each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically
  /// contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
  ///
  /// Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine
  /// the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

  /// The restriction is that you can't use two consecutive numbers (in an array) in a row.
  /// You can jump like this, 1, 3, 5, 7 or 2, 4, 6, 8. And you could also skip more than 1 number.
  /// You might do a one-pass scan from left to right, and compute the maximum values to such position.

  /// Please design two different algorithms to solve the same problem from two different design perspectives.
  /// Also, please ask for all the help you need along the way of your analysis and design efforts.
