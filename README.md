Design exercises

Please be aware: part of my intention with the exercises in this repository is to work with you in the role of a ‘mentor’, not just a ‘coach’. As you surely know, there are some differences between those roles; for example, the time perspective of the offered help. The help of a coach might focus on your short-term learnings, whereas the main focus of a mentor is on long-term professional changes —life-changing learnings, if possible.
 
Of course, the main goals of a mentor are much harder to achieve than the goals of a coach. But I should say ‘the goals of a mentorship’, because such hard work, by all means, is required from both of us. It is, by large, a synchronized effort. ☛ One first synchronization we should try is about the way you learn; that is, the way you achieve changes in your thought processes and habits of behavior.
 
For example, the Exercise #2 requires basic skills on distributed computing concepts and practices, along with acquaintance of concrete implementations of those concepts on .NET Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). As a coach, I could provide direct answers to related questions you may have on the subject matter. As a mentor, I should first wait to see your own effort to learn and then provide critical comments on what I see; moreover, a mentor might also present opposition to your efforts in order to provide additional learnings opportunities for you.
